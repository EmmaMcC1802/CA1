In the future, this would save a lot of time if I were working with a dataset with much more features, as it automatically provides information on missing values, duplications, preliminary information on correlations, etc. It negates the need for a lot of early exploration, like calling `.head()`, `.tail()`, `.columns`, `.info()`. Unfortunately this was after I'd done all the manual work below! It also gives some alerts, like highlighting columns with constants and the high missing value rate.

So, the net migration for both sexes for all countries may be interesting to look in order to identify patterns and maybe to predict Ireland's future migration. Furthermore, this data seems to be complete from 1992 onwards, which should also be a large enough dataset for a robust analysis if I so choose.\n",
